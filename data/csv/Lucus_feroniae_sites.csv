"5270",CLA84,Capena - Lucus Feroniae,,post 208 BC - beginning of the 2nd century BC-phase 1,"3",sacred,"Lucus Feroniae, discovered in 1952 at the locality of Bambocci, hosts one of the most important sanctuaries of the goddess Feronia in antiquity. Frequented as early as the Iron Age, it developed from the Archaic period onward, as evidenced by the materials found in the votive deposit. Rebuilt after the sack by Hannibal, the sanctuary is currently known only through the excavations of the temple constructed from the last decades of the 3rd century BCE, at the same time as the emergence of an initial settlement layout nearby. The sanctuary was abandoned and the area became a colony between the Sullan and Caesarian periods, but only during the principate of Augustus did it experience significant growth. The settlement was abandoned during Late Antiquity and became a source of spolia, with the construction of numerous lime kilns. At present, only some areas of the colony have been excavated (the forum, part of the sanctuary, the amphitheatre, and the baths), while others have been investigated through non-invasive methods (Kay et al. 2018).
